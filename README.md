util.py
- Url data structure for URL
    - figure out which metadata you want
    - make this a dictionary, which will go into our list later
    - figure out format

    - RANKING - non query ranking - PageRank? - assign this later 

- Store object 
    - Just a list for now
    - Future: implement priority queue for the ranking to display on server homepage
    - Future: implement lambda sort by ranking

server.py
    - add good post request that handles the utils and sends them back to the client



# Web Crawler
